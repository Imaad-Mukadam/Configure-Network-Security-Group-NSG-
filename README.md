## What is Network Security Group (NSG)??

A **Network Security Group (NSG)** in Azure is like a firewall that controls the flow of traffic to and from resources like virtual machines (VMs) and subnets. It works using a set of rules that allow or deny traffic based on factors like IP addresses, ports, and protocols (TCP/UDP). You can apply an NSG to a subnet to filter traffic for multiple VMs or directly to a VM for more specific control. This helps protect your resources by blocking unwanted access while allowing only necessary connections, improving security in your Azure environment.
